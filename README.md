## Day 1:
- HOLY GOD WHY WONT THIS IMAGE FLOAT NEXT TO MY TEXT WITHOUT BREAKING EVERYHTING AHHHHHHHHH
- Hey i got it working :)
## Day 2:
- Added flexbox to nav as well as logo
- working on changing logo shape in nav, having some issues
- figured out i need to give my logo the class="logo" tag instead of applying the styling to my a.logo div tags. Thanks Jessica for the flex presentation.
- added some adobe logo .png's and changed the color through the filter tag, really great resource here: https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp to figure out the values.
- Changed main to flex box so stuff looks better

## Write Up
Besides the grid set up taking a little while to get going correctly things for the most part cooperated. Images were awkward getting to get the same size, as you can see Casey's is still slightly larger because of the aspect ratio, changing height to 100% skews the other photos might try changing to 50% but i imagine that would just end upsquishing Casey. Couldn't remember early on how to make just certain portions of text to change color like in meet the team, applied <span> and a class id to accomplish the change. Also had a weird issue where my github pulls weren't up to date on my lap top but the issue seems to have fixed it self on its own.

## Day 1:
- Decided on a layout and to add black and white transition on hover (hopefully).
- Going to try a flex layout and see how it works if not will switch to grid!
- Tested flex layout and seems to work so far with my test images (which is the same image multiple times, might want to use photos with different AR in the future for these tests)
- Image hover and border hover seems to be working on test images as well, current background is black will need to either change figcaption color or add background to figures.
## Day 2:
- Started placing actual contents and images.
- Having a strange problem where the icons for links are making the boreder radius of their respective circles different sizes.
- Switched the background on the figures to grey to allow text legibility.
- Added a transition that also changes background color during image transition from b&w to color.
- Managed to somewhat fix the border for the logo links, some of them are still slightly off.

This was a lot of fun to setup! As i mentioned I was having issues with my buttons not conforming to the radius of their borders in some cases, this has something to do with the aspect ratio of the icons used, my best fix was to try and find a happy medium that made them look circular and the same size. Weird spacing issues with figcaption when pushing things to the next line.

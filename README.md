## Day 1:
- HOLY GOD WHY WONT THIS IMAGE FLOAT NEXT TO MY TEXT WITHOUT BREAKING EVERYHTING AHHHHHHHHH
- Hey i got it working :)
## Day 2:
- Added flexbox to nav as well as logo
- working on changing logo shape in nav, having some issues
- figured out i need to give my logo the class="logo" tag instead of applying the styling to my a.logo div tags. Thanks Jessica for the flex presentation.
- added some adobe logo .png's and changed the color through the filter tag, really great resource here: https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp to figure out the values.
- Changed main to flex box so stuff looks better

    <p>Hi! My name is Evan and I'm not 100% sure what I want to put here... I'm sure like some people or maybe most people I don't like to talk about myself so I'll try and keep it short if not sweet.</p>
<p>I am a graduate of SAIT's GCPT program (Graphic Communications and Print Technologies) and am currently enrolled in the Web Dev course through SAIT now, which explains this website I suppose.
    After a few years in the print industry and an unfortunate illness I have decided to switch paths and focus on the web; because lets be honest, print, while it does have its purposes is more limited in its uses.
</p>

<p>Prior to my time at SAIT I spent a lot of time in the sales area of different companies/industries including: PostMedia (Advertising Sales), Accurate Screen and Grating (manufacturing and distribution sales) and while in school as a Business Develpoment Agent for Dodge in Airdrie. </p>
<p class="left">I have a cat, this is her. Her name's Rain and she loves Temptations "tempties".</p>

<p class="left">Other than that I enjoy drawing ocasionally and playing video games in my spare time. Also I recently got into painting Warhammer, have yet to play!
